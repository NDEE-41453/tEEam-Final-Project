    "### Reflection Questions - Alex\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q1: How is what you are doing relevant to what you are learning?\n",
    "This week in lab we explored some more advanced methods for transmitting and demodulating bits. This is very relevant as we're implementing what we directly talked about and explored in lab like QPSK demodulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q2: How can you relate this to the real world? Give specific examples where this information can be useful.\n",
    "The QPSK symbol modulation allows for more data to be sent using the same amount of bandwidth compared to simple PAM modulating. In the real world bandwidth is very precious, and the more data that can get sent through the better. Thus what we did in lab is essential to the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q3: What was not so successful for you? Why?\n",
    "This week we had some issues with some of the code being incorrect the first time we worked through it. On the other hand, the hardware was the same as it has been and didn't have any issues. However, it did take a bit of time to diagnose where exactly the issue was. My two takeaways from this are 1) that it's important to have individual tests on different sections of the complete system to help isolate where issues are. My second observation is that with the same hardware setup we have, it is possible to transmit and demodulate a lot of different types of signals with varying levels of efficiency and error probabilities.\n",

    "#### Q4: What would you like to improve upon? How can you make these changes?\n",
    "While there are other things I would like to tackle for the final projects, I would find enjoyment in testing out different constellations to see how effective they are against different merit metrics (error probability/throughput). I would find it interesting to test different ones out in practice to see how closely different setups match up to what is expected mathematically."

    "#### Q1: What are you being asked to do and why?\n",
    "In this lab we started covering two algorithms for both frequency and phase offset estimation. The frequency offset estimation relied on using the FFT of a known preamble and look fo the matching peak in the data we are receiving. The phase offset estimation relied on calculating the average of the phase angles of the preamble samples. We then integrated both algorithms and tested in a transmitter-receiver system for both wired and wireless communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q2: What do you think about what you see and do?\n",
    "We saw how the algorithms introduce trade-offs in our design. For example, in the frequency offset estimation, one way of increasing the accuracy of the estimation is to increase the length of the FFT (which introduces more computational complexity) and/or to increase the length of the preamble (which reduces the effective transmission rate of the system). This trade-offs need to be weighted depending on the application. For example, maybe on a wireless communication channel we need to take a longer FFT than on wired. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q3: What was not so successful for you? Why?\n",
    "We were having some problems with the code for the last part of the lab. We thought our system was poorly connected since the reported BER was different than zero. But upon closer examination we noticed that the messages sent and received were the same, and that the issue was a bug in the code that reported the wrong BER value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q4: How is what you are doing relevant to what you are learning?\n",
    "Frequency and phase offsets introduce significant distortions in our signals as we saw in previous labs and lectures. If we want to build a robust communication system were the receiver and transmitter do not need to have a shared oscillator, we are highly interested in these mathematical tools to properly estimate the frequency and phase offset and compensate for them.\n",
